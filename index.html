<h2> Convivencia: </h2>
	<h3> "Convivencia refers to the ‘coexistence’ of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities in medieval Spain and by extension the cultural interaction and exchange fostered by such proximity." --Kenneth Wolf</h3>

<h2> Early Iberian Christians </h2>
	<h3> The Visigoths were barbarians who hailed from the Baltic region. Although they failed to realize it, they were the epitome of the Dark Ages, and tried to reject the remnants of the Romans who came before them. The Visigoths promoted Christianity, but not the Christian Church’s ideas. It can be argued that the person who truly united the church and monarchy was Bishop Isidore of Seville. </h3>

<h2> The Picaresque </h2>
	<h3> The classic Picaresque story has a trickster protagonist, or a Picarro. When Lazarillo de Tormes was first written, it gained popularity because of how different it was from the rest of the Picaresque genre. While Don Quixote and the other stories of knights from this time period were romantic stories of chivalry, Lazarillo was about much more real problems, such as hunger, poverty, and a boy’s simple struggle to survive. It is interesting to note that Lazarillo has a possible kinship with the Maqamat. Additionally, both Lazarillo and Don Quixote provide distinct social commentaries on the Christian society. </h3>

<h2> 1492 </h2>
	<h3> 1492 marked the end of Andalusia; Isabel and Ferdinand took Spain, Columbus sailed to the Americas, and the first Spanish dictionary was published. The following texts help analyze how this culture of tolerance could have disintegrated, and how we can try to interpret and remember it. </h3>
